# Public RPC Usage Report

This file was generated by the `./scripts/check-for-unused-public-rpcs` script.

If you're confused because git is showing changes to this file, it's likely
because you added a new public RPC function in a migration, but haven't used it
in code, yet. Generally speaking, this is something you'll want to be avoiding,
though if you have a good reason to do so, you can ignore this report changing.
